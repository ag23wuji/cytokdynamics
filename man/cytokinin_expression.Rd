\title{Cytokinin Expression Dataset}
\format{
A tibble with 210 rows and 8 variables:
\describe{
  \item{ba_concentration}{\code{chr}: The concentration of benzylaminopurine (BA), a cytokinin, in the treatment. Example: "500".}
  \item{treatment}{\code{chr}: The type of treatment applied (e.g., "direct").}
  \item{time}{\code{int}: The time (in minutes) since the treatment was applied.}
  \item{target}{\code{chr}: The gene target for expression analysis (e.g., "ARR5", "ARR6").}
  \item{relative_quantity_ratio}{\code{num}: The relative quantity of the target gene's expression, normalized to a reference.}
  \item{unscaled_expression_ratio}{\code{num}: The unscaled expression ratio of the target gene.}
  \item{expression_ratio}{\code{num}: The scaled expression ratio of the target gene.}
  \item{group}{\code{chr}: A concatenated identifier combining \code{ba_concentration}, \code{treatment}, and \code{target} (e.g., "500_direct_ARR5").}

}
\description{
A dataset containing cytokinin-related expression data for various treatments, time points, and targets. This dataset is commonly used for analyzing gene expression dynamics under different conditions.
}
\details{
This dataset provides insights into how different concentrations of cytokinin and treatments affect gene expression over time. It includes multiple replicates for statistical analysis.
