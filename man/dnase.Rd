\title{Sample Dataset: DNase Concentration and Density Measurements}
\format{
A data frame with 3 columns:
\describe{
  \item{Run}{\code{integer}. The identifier for each experimental run.}
  \item{conc}{\code{numeric}. The concentration of DNase in arbitrary units.}
  \item{density}{\code{numeric}. The measured density corresponding to the DNase concentration.}
}
}
\source{
Adapted from the \code{\link{DNase}} dataset in base R.
}
\usage{
dnase
}
\description{
This dataset is a sample inspired by the `DNase` dataset, containing measurements of DNase
concentration and the resulting density values for various runs.
}
\details{
The dataset contains measurements of DNase activity across 11 experimental runs. For each run,
DNase concentration values are recorded along with the corresponding density measurements.
The dataset can be used for demonstrating curve-fitting and analysis of enzyme activity.
